A mod that aims to add items from the Paper Mario series.

Made with vanilla Terraria gameplay in mind. The items included may either be too overpowered or not powerful enough for mods which add additional content to the game.

Items are either dropped as loot from enemies or crafted. Although the current release only features some items, future updates will feature cooking-related items.

The mod currently features up to 30 items adapted from the Paper Mario series--specifically, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.

Massive thanks to Jopojelly and TModLoader server's #mod-development-help channel! Couldn't have made the mod without them.

All Paper Mario assets used in the mod belongs to Intelligent Systems and Nintendo.
