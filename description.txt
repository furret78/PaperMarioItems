A mod that aims to add items from the Paper Mario series.

Created with vanilla Terraria gameplay in mind. The items included may either be too overpowered or not powerful enough for mods which add additional content to the game.

Items are either dropped as loot from enemies or crafted. Certain items will require the presence of a Cookbook and a suitable cooking environment in order to craft. The cooking system is inspired by Taco's Cooking Delight mod's.
The mod currently features items from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Future updates may introduce Paper Mario (N64) and Super Paper Mario variations and exclusives.

The cooking system is inspired by Taco's Cooking Delight mod.

To see which recipes correspond to which item, reference the list of recipes in TTYD on MarioWiki. Any recipes that require items resembling vanilla Terraria ones will use vanilla counterparts instead (e.g. Mango in place of Keel Mango).

Massive thanks to Jopojelly, Cube Root, Blobwin and TModLoader server's #mod-development-help channel! Couldn't have made the mod without them.

All Paper Mario assets used in the mod belongs to Intelligent Systems and Nintendo.

In-game mod icon was drawn by @sumrandomstuff on Discord.
