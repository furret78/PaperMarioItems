A mod that aims to add items from the Paper Mario series.

[h1] Balance [/h1]
Created with vanilla Terraria gameplay in mind. The items included may either be too overpowered or not powerful enough for mods which add additional content to the game.

[h1] Obtaining Items [/h1]
Items are either dropped as loot from enemies or crafted. Although the current release only features some items, future updates will feature cooking-related items.

The mod currently features items from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
