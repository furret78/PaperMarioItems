A mod that aims to add items from the Paper Mario series.

[h1] Balance [/h1]
Created with vanilla Terraria gameplay in mind. The items included may either be too overpowered or not powerful enough for mods which add additional content to the game.

[h1] Obtaining Items [/h1]
Items are either dropped as loot from enemies or crafted. Certain items will require the presence of a Cookbook and a suitable cooking environment in order to craft.

The cooking system is inspired by Taco's Cooking Delight mod.

The mod currently features items from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Future updates may introduce Paper Mario (N64) and Super Paper Mario variations and exclusives.

Massive thanks to Jopojelly, Cube Root, Blobwin and TModLoader server's #mod-development-help channel! Couldn't have made the mod without them.


All Paper Mario assets used in the mod belongs to Intelligent Systems and Nintendo.
